Once published, information can't be taken back - this means if you're editing content in tale:net information won't be deleted, but updated. Imagine a history of actions and information, written into tale:net by all identities. Find out more about the technical backround of ssb, the distributed secure gossip platform tale:net is based on, {ssbLink}.",
