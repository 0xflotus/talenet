Pushing an idea means to send it to the tale:verse and \"tag\" it with skills that might be needed to realize it. Thereby, ideas are always shown to those people that have the skills and therefore knowledge to help an idea evolve and realize it. Your ideas are those you're thinking about, not necessarily those you came up with.",

"You'll not set a password for your tale:net identity, because it works with asymetric encryption. The easy way to explain this: There is a private key saved to your computer that works like a password and there is a public key visible to other people that works like a signature. If you want to be safe, you can [backup your key pair](Link save secret) to a trusted location like your usb stick, but keep it secret.",
